# The Movie App

Mark movies you watched or plan to watch, for either yourself or to share with
your friends.

## Prerequisites:

- Ruby 1.9
- Bundler
- MongoDB running
- Secret API keys for:
  - Netflix
  - TMDb
  - Rotten Tomatoes
  - Twitter

To get the keys, you either need to register an API account with each of these
services and configure them in `config/settings.local.yml`, or you can ask
Mislav for ones that we use in production.
